# here an explanation for the output form is given:

##a form will be looked like this:

##(v5) 0 0.5675194263458252 s [67, 225] 11.666666666666666 [0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 12, 13, 4, 13, 17, 23, 27, 17, 29, 5, 29, 41, 32, 41, 42, 13, 32, 12, 18, 51, 52, 41, 57, 50, 64, 27, 67] 0

##According to the sequence, the meaning for each element can be explained as follows:

##(v5), ith generation, used cpu time, s(second), [the fitness value for two solutions from our algorithm], deviation from optimum (%), best solution from our algorithm, penalty

####v5--- no meaning here;
####0----- here is the 1th iteration;
####0.5675194263458252-------CPU use time;
####s-------- second;
####[67, 225]----the fitness value for two solutions from our algorithm 
####11.666666666666666------the deviation ratio(%);
####[0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 12, 13, 4, 13, 17, 23, 27, 17, 29, 5, 29, 41, 32, 41, 42, 13, 32, 12, 18, 51, 52, 41, 57, 50, 64, 27, 67]----the solution schedule;
####0--------penalty;
