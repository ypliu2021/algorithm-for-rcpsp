## Supplement 0: The form of result with explnation 


Supplement   the example of case j3023_7.sm. The optimum is 60, given from the open website. 

**Output format:**
```
v5, ith generation, used cpu time, s(second), [the fitness value for two solutions from our algorithm], deviation from optimum (%), best solution from our algorithm, penalty 
```
