## LMGA: A late-mover genetic algorithm for resource-constrained project-scheduling problems

### 1. Introduction
This is the support website for the LMGA. The appendix files store the solutions for RCPSP at [psblib](http://www.om-db.wi.tum.de/psplib/library.html) 


###  2. Experimental results
Following is an example of the output of our algorithm:
```
(v5) 0⎵0.5675194263458252 s⎵[67, 225]⎵11.666666666666666⎵[0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 12, 13, 4, 13, 17, 23, 27, 17, 29, 5, 29, 41, 32, 41, 42, 13, 32, 12, 18, 51, 52, 41, 57, 50, 64, 27, 67]⎵0
```
**The above result can be explained as follows:**
(v5) ith generation⎵used cpu time s(second)⎵[the fitness value for two solutions from our algorithm]⎵deviation from optimum (%)⎵[best solution from our algorithm]⎵penalty
