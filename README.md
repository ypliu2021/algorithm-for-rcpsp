///the appendix files store the solutions for RCPSP in psblib (http://www.om-db.wi.tum.de/psplib/library.html)
///notation: this is the example for reading the output from our algorithm
///the output from our algorithm is showed as follows:
(v5) 0 0.5675194263458252 s [67, 225] 11.666666666666666 [0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 12, 13, 4, 13, 17, 23, 27, 17, 29, 5, 29, 41, 32, 41, 42, 13, 32, 12, 18, 51, 52, 41, 57, 50, 64, 27, 67] 0
/////it can be explained as follows:
(v5,) ith generation, used cpu time, s(second), [the fitness value for two solutions from our algorithm], deviation from optimum (%), best solution from our algorithm, penalty///
