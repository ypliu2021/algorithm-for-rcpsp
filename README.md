## LMGA: A late-mover genetic algorithm for resource-constrained project-scheduling problems

### 1. Introduction
This is the support website for the LMGA. The appendix files store the solutions for RCPSP at [psblib](http://www.om-db.wi.tum.de/psplib/library.html) 


###  2. Experimental results
Following is an example of the output of our algorithm:
```
j6010_1 [0, 0, 11, 10, 11, 12, 20, 22, 9, 44, 27, 21, 17, 66, 13, 56, 42, 31, 14, 18, 28, 22, 51, 55, 49, 36, 41, 33, 57, 34, 37, 70, 36, 32, 53, 71, 67, 62, 56, 30, 52, 64, 57, 42, 50, 63, 62, 55, 57, 77, 74, 65, 70, 59, 71, 67, 75, 83, 77, 76, 84, 85] 85 0.0 1.18
```
**The above result can be explained as follows:**
the name of instance⎵[best solution from our algorithm]⎵duration for this instance⎵deviation from optimum (%)⎵use time(seconds)
